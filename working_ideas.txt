There needs to be a clear way for the player to tell the difference between background and foreground objects. 


Things that would be impactful:
- More different asteroid sprites
- Active Rotation (scaled with size and random speed)
- Variable static rotational position (if not rotating)
- Space Dust (bad idea(maybe worth trying anyway?)) 



A "Background visual" would help a lot. This could be a planet or a very large ship. What it needs to be: 
- interesting
- static (no parallax movement)
- maybe just starfield? 


A "Large Parallax Object" would help
- Mining Colony
- Orbital Structure, like a space station or somthin
- Planet colony (think domes on mars or even a continent (could be earth, could be some other planet) wiih lights in the shape of cities like we see on Earth)

Needs to be measured in kilometers, so as to still move in parallax, but very slowly.
